## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Failed

**Problem**: GitHub CLI authentication failed

**Solutions:**

1. Ensure `github-token` is properly set
2. Check token permissions include `contents: write`
3. Verify repository access rights

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write  # Required for creating releases
  discussions: write  # Required if using discussion-category
```

#### Tag Already Exists

**Problem**: tag already exists

**Solutions:**

1. Use `verify-tag: true` to check existing tags
2. Choose a different tag name
3. Delete existing tag if appropriate

```yaml
- name: "Check existing tags"
  run: git tag --list | grep "v1.0.0" || echo "Tag not found"
```

#### No Assets Found

**Problem**: Asset files not found

**Solutions:**

1. Verify file paths are correct
2. Check build artifacts were created
3. Use absolute paths if relative paths fail

```yaml
- name: "List available files"
  run: find . -name "*.zip" -o -name "*.tar.gz" | head -10
```

#### Release Creation Failed

**Problem**: Release creation failed

**Solutions:**

1. Check repository permissions
2. Verify tag format is valid
3. Ensure required fields are provided
